						Our mission is to create the best festival experience possible for
						all young adults - not just new internationals or Dutch students
						from university.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are actively bridging this gap through frequent events that host
						local and international artists alike. For instance, our most recent
						annual festival hosted DJ's from 10 different nationalities, and
						this is reflected in the diversity of our audience.
