## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This is an Astro 5 project with React integration. Key architectural decisions:

- **Framework**: Astro with React
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4.x
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE npm or yarn)
- **Path Mapping**: `#/*` maps to `./src/*` for clean imports

## üß™ Unit Tests

- `unit`: Plain node environment for simple unit tests involving pure functions.
- `integration`:
  - Database tests with testcontainers.
  - UI component tests with vitest browser mode.
